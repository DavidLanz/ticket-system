## Exploratory Data Analysis with ticket system data

## Introduction
The repository consists of two folders `webflow` and `ticket`. Explanation of how it works and what's inside the folder are provided below.

**webflow:**   
- This folder uses a webflow record of a ticket system website, called it `webflowdata.xlsx`.         
- The whole process of the analysis and thorough detail of the dataset used was shown in the `webflow.md` file. 
- The `webflow.R` contains just the R code for the analysis, though may not be as organized as well-explained.                  
- `webflow_files` contains the graph that the analysis generated.                

**ticket:**          
- This folder uses the ticket selling record to one of the concert provided by the same ticket system as above. The dataset is called `ticketdata.csv`.
- It also contains a .md file `ticket.md` that shows the entire steps for doing the analysis(Also contains description of the dataset) and the partial R code for that `ticket.R`.
- Apart from that it also has a `seat.png` which shows the structure of the arena in which the concert was held. It will be used with the `image.R` file.
- `processdata.csv` is a subset of the original dataset(the processing steps are given in the `ticket.md`) and will be used by `image.R`.
- What `image.R` does is, it contains a function image, you can pass a timeline to it, and it will do a plotting on the `seat.png`. The plot will show you a number of tickets available for each section in the timeline you specified. An example of how it is used it also in the `ticket.md` file.
- `ticket_files` contains the plot generated by the analysis.
